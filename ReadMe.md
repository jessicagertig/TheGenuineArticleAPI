# The Genuine Article API #

An API created to store information about historical garment images as provided digitally by various museums and collections.  

## Motivation and Purpose ##

First, to preserve information regarding images of historical clothing in order to prevent 'orphaned' images. (Images which have been reposted or uploaded and lost any information or links to source information).  

In particular this will preserve any digital records from small collections or museums that later no longer maintain websites, and any digital records provided by museums on a revolving basis, in the manner of a temporary digital exhibit. 

Second, to collect images of historical clothing and related information in one repository. Eventually this will be a public API.  This API will also serve a web application that will allow the records to be searched.

## Scope ##

For the time being this project will be limited to western clothing from the 19th century, particularly women's clothing, and as a result of limited examples of working class clothing will by default feature clothing which middle to upper class women would have typically worn.

## Status ##

*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*

Draft documentation of the API will be updated as the project proceeds:
